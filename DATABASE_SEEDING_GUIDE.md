## üöÄ Seeding Commands

### **Option 1: Complete Fresh Start (Recommended)**
Drops all tables, recreates them, and seeds everything:

```bash
cd src
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

**This will create**:
- ‚úÖ All database tables
- ‚úÖ Roles and permissions
- ‚úÖ 57 users (2 admins, 5 editors, 50 authors)
- ‚úÖ ~250-500 posts with realistic content
- ‚úÖ ~1,250-25,000 comments

**Estimated time**: 30-60 seconds

---

### **Option 2: Seed Only (Keep Existing Data)**
Runs seeders without dropping tables:

```bash
cd src
php artisan db:seed
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This will create duplicate data if run multiple times.

---

### **Option 3: Seed Specific Seeders**

#### Seed only users:
```bash
cd src
php artisan db:seed --class=UsersSeeder
```

#### Seed only posts and comments:
```bash
cd src
php artisan db:seed --class=PostsAndCommentsSeeder
```

#### Seed only roles and permissions:
```bash
cd src
php artisan db:seed --class=RolesAndPermissionsSeeder
```
