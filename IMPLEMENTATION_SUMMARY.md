# Implementation Summary: Roles & Permissions System

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
**Migrations Created:**
- ✅ `create_roles_table.php` - Stores roles (admin, editor, viewer)
- ✅ `create_permissions_table.php` - Stores permissions (12 total)
- ✅ `create_role_user_table.php` - Many-to-many relationship between users and roles
- ✅ `create_permission_role_table.php` - Many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions
- ✅ Updated `create_posts_table.php` - Added user_id, title (unique), body, status (enum), published_at (nullable) fields
- ✅ Updated `create_comments_table.php` - Added user_id, post_id, content fields

### 2. Models
**Created/Updated:**
- ✅ `Permission.php` - Permission model with role relationships
- ✅ `Role.php` - Role model with user and permission relationships, helper methods
- ✅ `Post.php` - Post model with user and comment relationships
- ✅ `Comment.php` - Comment model with user and post relationships
- ✅ `User.php` - Extended with:

  - Post and comment relationships
  - Helper methods: `hasRole()`, `hasPermission()`, `assignRole()`, `removeRole()`
  - Convenience methods: `isAdmin()`, `isEditor()`, `isAuthor()`, `isViewer()`
  - Permission checking: `can()`

### 3. Seeders
**Created:**
- ✅ `RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php` - Seeds:
  - 4 roles: admin, editor, author, viewer

  - Role-permission assignments
- ✅ Updated `DatabaseSeeder.php` - Creates test users with roles:
  - admin@example.com (admin role)
  - editor@example.com (editor role)
  - author@example.com (author role)
  - viewer@example.com (viewer role)

### 4. Middleware
**Created:**
- ✅ `CheckRole.php` - Validates user has required role(s)
- ✅ `CheckPermission.php` - Validates user has required permission
- ✅ Registered in `bootstrap/app.php` as:
  - `role` middleware
  - `permission` middleware

### 5. Controllers

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
cd src
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Seed Database
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

This will create:
- Roles and permissions
- Test users (admin, editor, author, viewer)

### 3. Test the System
Use the test users to verify different permission levels:
- Login as viewer → Try to create post (should fail with 403)
- Login as author → Create post (should succeed)
- Login as author → Try to edit another user's post (should fail with 403)
- Login as editor → Edit any post (should succeed)
- Login as admin → Manage users (should succeed)

### 4. Optional: Customize
- Add more roles in the seeder
- Add more permissions
- Customize permission assignments
- Add more granular permissions
